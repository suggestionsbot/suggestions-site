              Manage these suggestions with the <code>approve</code> or <code>reject</code> commands so you and the

            <p>Want to change what emojis are added to suggestions? Us too, sometimes. Simply use the <code>setvotes</code>
              command to do that!</p>

            <p>What about the prefix? Or the suggestions channel? Don't worry. We have that covered üëç. You can use
              commands like <code>setprefix</code> and <code>setchannel</code> to do that.

              And there's one more thing... you can add/remove any roles you want to manage suggestions. Check out
              the <code>role</code> command as well as the <code>roles</code> command if you want to view who can
              manage suggestions.
